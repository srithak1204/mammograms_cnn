## Features
- **Mammogram classification**: 
The CNN is capable of accurately classifying mammograms
- **Evaluation Metrics**:
Usage of relevant evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for assessing the model's classification performance.
- **Regularization Techniques**: Integration of regularization techniques (e.g., dropout) to prevent overfitting and enhance the generalization ability of the model.
- **Activation Functions**: The choice of appropriate activation functions, such as ReLU or sigmoid, to introduce non-linearity into the network and capture complex relationships in the data.
- **Loss Function**: Selection of an appropriate loss function, such as categorical cross-entropy, to measure the difference between predicted and true class probabilities during training.
- **Hidden Layers**:
The network architecture includes hidden layers to facilitate the learning of intricate patterns and representations in the dataset.
- **Output Layer**:
The output layer is configured to produce probabilities or scores for mammograms, allowing for easy interpretation of classification results.
